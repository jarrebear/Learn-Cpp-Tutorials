// Write a short program to simulate a ball being dropped off of a tower. To start, the user should be asked
// for the height of the tower in meters. Assume normal gravity (9.8 m/s2), and that the ball has no initial velocity (the ball is not moving to start). 
//Have the program output the height of the ball above the ground after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 seconds. The ball should not go underneath the ground (height 0).

// Use a function to calculate the height of the ball after x seconds. The function can calculate how far the ball has fallen after x seconds using the following formula: distance fallen = gravity_constant * x_seconds2 / 2

// Expected output:
// Enter the height of the tower in meters: 100
// At 0 seconds, the ball is at height: 100 meters
// At 1 seconds, the ball is at height: 95.1 meters
// At 2 seconds, the ball is at height: 80.4 meters
// At 3 seconds, the ball is at height: 55.9 meters
// At 4 seconds, the ball is at height: 21.6 meters
// At 5 seconds, the ball is on the ground.
